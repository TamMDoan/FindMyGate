Passion project. A navigation application specifically for airports in order to reduce the likelihood of passengers getting lost. 

# About
Never be afraid to travel to or through airports again! FindMyGate is an application where the user can enter their current gate and their destination gate, and FindMyGate will guide the user to their gate with a set of instructions for the shortest path to take.

[ ] MVP will allow the user to find a path to a gate within a single terminal upon entering starting point and destination. Path will be given as a set of gates to go by.
